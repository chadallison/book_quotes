### *Atomic Habits* - James Clear

- “We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our
  lives often depends on the quality of our habits.” (7)
- “A very small shift in direction can lead to a very meaningful change
  in destination.” (17)

### *Best Seat in the House* - Jack Nicklaus II & Don Yeager

- “Mom has always said men are simple, and they need three things: food,
  love, and encouragement – and they will be fine.” (95)
- “You never know what other people are going through in their lives.
  Even a small interaction when passing someone on a sidewalk can
  entirely change a person’s day. Being respectful, appreciative, kind,
  caring, and listening to and learning from your friends, family, and
  strangers is very important. As big as our world is, it truly is
  small.” (122)

### *Let My People Go Surfing* - Yvon Chouinard

- “If we could all come to see our consumer products as tools that help
  us to live our real lives – rather than as substitutes and surrogates
  for that life – we would need many fewer products to be happy. (Naomi
  Klein, XI)

### *Why We Run: A Natural History* - Bernd Heinrich

- “… it turns out that what you have is less important than what you do
  with it.” (83)
- “The mind leads, the body follow.” (126)
- “Running is perhaps the most fundamental of all sports, and it is
  economically the least costly to perform. As a consequence, it is the
  most democratic and most competitive of all sports because individual
  merit can prevail despite economic inequality. It is a sport for
  everyone, the whole world over.” (193)
- “Sure, it’s genetic. But nobody could rationally propose that European
  women are not equally genetically endowed to be able to do precisely
  the same. They just don’t have the same exposure to a culture that
  fosters the practice from very early childhood and then channels
  development … Talent is not enough.” (195)
- “The talent lies not in our genes but in our minds.” (196)
- “Ultimately we are shaped by the anvil of our environment and the
  hammer of our mind, if used.” (197)
- “To psych oneself up takes self-delusion … At that point, one needs
  faith – a combination of ignorance, deliberate blindness, hope, and
  optimism. It defies logic yet makes us able to strive and to survive.”
  (250)
- “Now if you are going to win the battle, you have to do one thing. You
  have to make the mind run the body. Never let the body tell the mind
  what to do. The body will always give up. The body can only handle
  little steps. The mind can take great leaps.” (254)
- “The cup is full. It contains what I had put into it. Like catching an
  antelope, the best things in life that we can experience are served on
  the challenge to endure and to overcome in the long run.” (259)
- “One learns more from one’s mistakes than from one’s successes, and I
  therefore concentrate on them.” (264)
- “Running has saved his life … He had won big. His brain had done it.
  He thought he could do it, and did it. He could have been dead wrong.
  I also feel that I owe much to my running – my education, my health,
  and maybe my life.” (266)
