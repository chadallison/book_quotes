### *Atomic Habits* - James Clear

- “We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our
  lives often depends on the quality of our habits.” (7)
- “A very small shift in direction can lead to a very meaningful change
  in destination.” (17)
- “Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like
  complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from
  twenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is
  just being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees.” (21)
- “’When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering
  away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack
  showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two,
  and I know it was not that last blow that die it – but all that had
  gone before.” (21)
- “‘The score takes care of itself.’ The same is true for other areas of
  life. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals.
  Focus on your system instead.” (24)
- “When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them
  temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems
  at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix
  themselves.” (25)
- “It makes no sense to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when
  there are many paths to success.” (26)
- “The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to *become* a runner.”
  (34)
- “The most practical way to change *who* you are is to change *what*
  you do. (38)
- “If you keep casting the same votes you’ve always cast, you’re going
  to get the same results you’ve always had. If nothing changes, nothing
  is going to change.” (39)
- “They make you think that you have to choose between building habits
  and attaining freedom. In reality, the two compliment each other.”
  (46)
- “Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior.” (82)
- “You don’t have to be the victim of your environment. You can also be
  the architect of it.” (84)
- “Environment design allows you to take back control and become the
  architect of your life. Be the desginer of your world and not merely
  the consumer of it.” (87)
- “In the long-run, we become a product of the environment that we live
  in. To put it bluntly, I have never seen someone consistently stick to
  positive habits in a negative environment.” (94)
- “People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting
  situations. It’s easier to avoid temptation than resist it.” (95)
- “Ultimately, such strategies enable food scientists to find the”bliss
  point” for each product – the precise combination of salt, sugar, and
  fat that excites your brain and keeps you coming back for more. The
  result, of course, is that you overeat because hyperpalatable foods
  are more attractive to the human brain.” (103)
- “… whatever habits are normal in your culture are among the most
  attractive behaviors you’ll find.” (114)
- “The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to
  us.” (122)
- “One person might learn to reduce stress by smoking a cigarette.
  Another person learns to ease their anxiety by going for a run. Your
  current habits are not necessarily the best way to solve the problems
  you face; they are just the methods you learned to use. Once you
  associate a solution with the problem you need to solve, you keep
  coming back to it.” (128)
- “Life feels reactive, but it is actually predictive. All day long, you
  are making your best guess of how to act given what you’ve just seen
  and what has worked for you in the past. You are endlessly predicting
  what will happen in the next moment.” (129)
- “… our behavior is heavily dependent on how we interpret the events
  that happen to us, not necessarily the objective reality of the events
  themselves.” (129)
- “… for many of us, a little bit of friction can be the difference
  between sticking with a good habit or sliding into a bad one.” (158)
- “The point is to master the habit of showing up. The truth is, a habit
  must be established before it can be improved.” (163)
- “… the costs of your good habits are in the present. The costs of your
  bad habits are in the future.” (189)
- “… the last mile is always the least crowded.” (190)
- “The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral
  of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident.
  Missing twice is the start of a new habit.” (201)
- “… when successful people fail, they rebound quickly. The breaking of
  a habit doesn’t matter if the reclaiming of it is fast.” (201)
- “In our data-driven world, we tend to overvalue numbers and undervalue
  anything ephemeral, soft, and difficult to quantify. We mistakenly
  think the factors we can measure are the only factors that exist. But
  just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most
  important thing. And just because you *can’t* measure something
  doesn’t mean it’s not important at all.” (203)
- “When you can’t win by being better, you can win by being different.”
  (225)
- “Boiling water will soften a potato but harden an egg. You can’t
  control whether you’re a potato or an egg, but you can decide to play
  a game where it’s better to be hard or soft.” (226)
- “Until you work as hard as those you admire, don’t explain away their
  success as luck.” (227)
- “‘10 years spent learning, 4 years spent refining, and 4 years as a
  wild success.’” (230)
- “‘Men desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well
  wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly.’” (234)
- “… everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of
  self-improvement: you have to fall in love with boredom.” (235)
- “Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It’s the ability to
  keep going when work isn’t exciting that makes the difference.” (237)
- “Being curious is better than being smart. Being motivated and curious
  counts for more than being smart because it leads to action.” (261)
- “Your actions reveal how bad you want something. If you keep saying
  something is a priority but you never act on it, then you don’t really
  want it. It’s time to have an honest conversation with yourself. Your
  actions reveal your true motivations.” (262)

### *Best Seat in the House* - Jack Nicklaus II & Don Yeager

- “Mom has always said men are simple, and they need three things: food,
  love, and encouragement – and they will be fine.” (95)
- “You never know what other people are going through in their lives.
  Even a small interaction when passing someone on a sidewalk can
  entirely change a person’s day. Being respectful, appreciative, kind,
  caring, and listening to and learning from your friends, family, and
  strangers is very important. As big as our world is, it truly is
  small.” (122)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### *Jesus and John Wayne* - Kristin Kobes Du Mez

- “… to Trump and his evangelical supporters alike, restoring white
  patriarchal power would make America great again.” (XVI)
- “Christian nationalism – the belief that America is God’s chosen
  nation and must be defended as such – serves as a powerful predictor
  of intolerance toward immigrants, racial minorities, and
  non-Christians. It is linked to opposition to gay rights and gun
  control, to support for harsher punishments for criminals, to
  justifications for the use of excessive force against black Americans
  in law enforcement situations, and to traditionalist gender ideology.”
  (4)
- “‘I would rather see my four girls shot and die as little girls who
  have faith in God than leave them to die some years later as godless,
  faithless, soulless Communists.’” (Pat Boone, 41)
- “\[Marabel\] Morgan offered practical tips to help women ‘become the
  sunshine’ in their homes, advice that included time management, more
  efficient meal planning (prepare your dinner salads right after
  breakfast), and weight loss. Most importantly, women just need to stop
  nagging their husbands.” (60)
- “Morgan’s solution was simple: treat your husband like a king, revere
  him, and cater to his every need. This was especially important for
  working women, because a man’s ‘masculinity may be threatened by your
  paycheck.’ A wife needed to let her husband know that he was her hero,
  and it was her job to put her husband’s ‘tattered ego’ back together
  at the end of each day by admiring his masculine qualities – his
  muscles, or whiskers.” (61)
- “In this way, proponents of ‘biblical law’ married ‘traditional’
  gender roles to unrestrained, free-market capitalism. It was a match
  made in heaven.” (76)
- “… the notion of personal rights interfered with the hierarchical
  structure of authority, contradicting God’s design and provoking only
  anger and resentment.” (76)
- “Men liked to ‘hunt and fish and hike in the wilderness’ while women
  preferred to ‘stay at home and wait for them.’ Men played sports as
  women watched, ‘yawning on the sidelines.’ But perhaps the most
  profound difference between men and women, according to Dobson, was
  their source of self-esteem: ‘Men derive self-esteem by being
  *respected*; women feel worthy when they are *loved*.’” (83-84)
- “But family values politics was never about protecting the well-being
  of families generally. Fundamentally, evangelical ‘family values’
  entailed the reassertion of patriarchal authority. At its most basic
  level, family values politics was about sex and power.” (88)
- “Threats of a spiritual and cultural nature required a militant
  Christianity; threats to the nation required unrestrained militarism.”
  (100)
- “… and for conservatives, ‘tough on crime’ generally connoted only
  certain types of crime: ‘street crime,’ or the threat of black men.
  Domestic violence, sexual assault, and child abuse didn’t register.”
  (105)
- “After all, as evangelicals saw it, the Cold War wasn’t really all
  that different from the Wild West. Violence, or the threat of
  violence, secured order. Rules might have to be broken, but the ends
  justified the means. What was needed was a strong leader, a man who
  could assert masculine power in the international arena.” (110-111)
- “Cole had no use for ‘sissified’ portraits of Jesus that failed to
  reveal his true character. ‘*Christlikeness and manhood are
  synonymous*,’ he insisted, and to be Christlike, to be a man, required
  ‘a certain ruthlessness.’” (125)
- “Women, children, churches, and nations all needed masculine decision
  makers; America was great only when its men were great.” (125)
- “Falwell sparked controversy by characterizing AIDS as ‘the wrath of
  God upon homosexuals’ and recommending that those with AIDS be
  quarantined.” (135)
- “Republicans wasted no time in impugning Dukakis’s patriotism and
  sabotaging his masculinity – and in their view the two were closely
  connected.” (137)
- “Inspired by their interpretation of biblical prophecies in the Book
  of Revelation, conservative Protestants had long feared a ‘one-world’
  government that would be ruled over by the Antichrist.” (138)
- “Even worse, as a feminist and a career woman, Hillary Rodham had
  provoked the ire of religion conservatives when she refused to take
  her husband’s name.” (140)
- “Not only did this smack of socialism as far as conservatives were
  concerned, by the Christian Coalition insisted that health-care reform
  concealed a ‘radical social agenda,’ ostensibly by promoting abortion,
  gay rights, and sex education.” (140)
- “Clinton’s job rating received a significant boost as the scandal
  unfolded – ‘the formerly feminized president had been resurrected as a
  phallic leader.’” (144)
- “Within their own circles, evangelicals didn’t have a strong record
  when it came to defending women against harassment and abuse.” (144)
- “Without the threat of Godless communism to justify militant Christian
  masculinity, many evangelical men began to express uncertainty about
  what manhood in fact required.” (149)
- “Unfortunately, the church was part of the problem. Failing to present
  the true Jesus, it instead depicted him ‘as a meek and gentle
  milk-toast character’ – a man who never could have inspired ‘brawny
  fishermen like Peter to follow him.’ It was time to replace this
  ‘Sunday school Jesus’ with a warrior Jesus.” (161)
- “‘What if we told me up front that to join the church of Jesus Christ
  is … to enlist in God’s army and to place their lives on the line?’”
  (161)
- “As ‘point man,’ the father needed to protect sons from feminization.
  Boys, he explained, were naturally aggressive due to their higher
  levels of testosterone; aggression was ‘part of being male.’” (163)
- “‘They will survive the scars and broken bones of boyhood,’ Farrar
  wrote, ‘but they cannot survive being feminized.’ Boys who were
  overprotected, particularly by mothers, were in danger of having their
  masculinity ‘warped.’” (163)
- “God created men and women ‘equal before God’ yet ‘distinct in their
  manhood in womanhood.’ The statement attested that God had established
  male headship as part of the order of creation and closed the door to
  women in church leadership.” (167)
- “As early as 1981, President Reagan began directing government funding
  to abstinence-only sex education … Here was a case of government
  intrusion into the most intimate of matters, yet evangelicals didn’t
  seem to mind.” (171-172)
- “Yearning to know they were powerful and dangerous, someone to be
  reckoned with, they specialized in inventing games ‘where bloodshed is
  a prerequisite for having fun.’ God made men to be dangerous, Eldredge
  explained.” (173)
- “According to Eldredge, God created all men to long for ‘a battle to
  fight, an adventure to live, and a beauty to rescue.’” (174)
- “He praised Dabney’s ‘prophetic’ views on the evils of public
  education and women’s equality, and he found Dabney’s anti-feminism
  ‘refreshingly virile.’ Phillips skirted around Dabney’s proslavery
  sentiments, although Phillips, too, diminished the horrors of slavery
  and denied the genocide of Native Americans.” (190)
- “In a language that would have been familiar to many among his flock,
  Driscoll insisted that real men avoided church because they had no
  interest in a ‘Richard Simmons, hippie, queer Christ.’” (193)
- “For Driscoll, the problem went all the way back to the biblical Adam,
  a man who plunged humanity headlong into ‘hell/feminism’ by listening
  to his wife.” (195)
- “Driscoll thrived on manufacturing a sense of threat posed by
  outsiders … Driscoll incited fear in order to maintain control.” (196)
- “‘I remember being fascinated by the way that he would talk about
  things in the sermons no one was talking about, like how sex plays an
  important role in marriage, and how ’pussified’ the church was
  becoming … I didn’t recognize the misogyny in his theology at the
  time, as a stereotypical beta male, it was like an invitation to
  become important …’” (198)
- “Every man dies, but not every man truly lives.” (217)
- “On the part of evangelical leaders, at the very least, fear of Islam
  appeared to be nothing more than an attempt to drum up support for the
  militant faith they were hawking.” (218)
- “With books like the not-so-subtly titled *Why We Want to Kill You*,
  they positioned American Christians as victims, thereby justifying an
  extreme response. They accused any and all detractors of having ties
  to Islamic terrorism and used imagined threats of violence to bolster
  their own credibility.” (225)
- “For these neocons, the military embodied the nation’s highest ideals
  even as it unleashed violence and death, and there was no
  contradiction. War would provide Americans with”moral clarity.” (230)
- *Duck Dynasty*, the reality television show featuring the Robertson
  family, debuted in 2008, and by 2013 it had become one of the most
  popular shows on television, with its fourth season premier drawing
  almost twelve million viewers, more than the highest viewed episodes
  of critical favorites *Breaking Bad* and *Mad Men* combined. (244-245)
- ““… social scientists identified a curious ‘Trump effect.’ Five years
  earlier, only 30 percent of white evangelicals believed that ‘a person
  who commits an ’immoral’ act could behave ethically in a public role.’
  The month before the \[2016\] election, 72 percent believed this was
  possible.” (268)
- “Yet Piper himself had a less-than-stellar record when it came to
  dealing with abuse … If her husband was asking her to engage in ‘group
  sex or something really weird, bizarre, harmful,’ then she might very
  gentle refuse to submit, but if the abuse was just hurting her and not
  requiring her to sin, then she should endure ‘verbal abuse for a
  season’ – and ‘perhaps being smacked one night.’ Only then should she
  seek help … from the church.” (293)
- “A common sense of embattlement also links the rhetoric of the NRA to
  that of conservative white evangelicalism. For both, a bunker
  mentality strengthens identity and loyalty, and fuels militancy.”
  (296)
- “Masculine authority, militarism, and the sexual and spiritual
  subordination of women have simply been part of the air evangelicals
  breathe for decades. In Sunday schools and Vacation Bible Schools boys
  learn to be superheroes for Christ, and girls to be beautiful
  princesses.” (298)
- “With few exceptions, black men, Middle Eastern men, and Hispanic men
  are *not* called to wild, militant masculinity. Their aggression, by
  contrast, is seen as dangerous, a threat to the stability of home and
  nation.” (301)
- “Militantly patriarchal expressions of the faith thrived in male-only
  discussion spaces, and so for some men, it was by listening to
  Christian women that the darker aspects of evangelical masculinity
  became visible.” (302)

### *Let My People Go Surfing* - Yvon Chouinard

- “If we could all come to see our consumer products as tools that help
  us to live our real lives – rather than as substitutes and surrogates
  for that life – we would need many fewer products to be happy. (Naomi
  Klein, XI)
- “If you just ask people for help – if you just admit that you don’t
  know something – they will fall all over themselves trying to help.”
  (38)
- “Since we were the first catalog in the United States to use recycled
  paper, the result was a disaster the first season … But in that first
  year alone our switching to recycled paper saved 3.5 million
  kilowatt-hours of electricity and 6 million gallons of water; kept
  52,000 pounds of pollutants out of the air and 1,560 cubic yards of
  solid waste out of landfills, and prevented 14,500 trees from being
  felled.” (57)
- “If you’re really serious about giving money away, you’d sell the
  company for a hundred million or so, keep a couple million for
  yourselves, and put the rest in a foundation.” (60)
- “The more you know, the less you need.” (80)
- “The Dalai Lama says too much choice brings unhappiness.” (86)
- “When I’m working on a problem, I never think about beauty. I think
  only how to solve the problem. But when I have finished, if the
  solution is not beautiful, I know it is wrong.” (91)
- “Again, like the Zen approach to archery or anything else, you
  identify the goal and then forget about it and concentrate on the
  process.” (117)
- “It’s okay to be eccentric, as long as you are rich; otherwise, you’re
  just crazy.” (151)
- “A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his
  work and his play … to himself, he always appears to be doing both.”
  (157)
- “Hiring people with diverse backgrounds brings in a flexibility of
  thought and openness to new ways of doing things, as opposed to hiring
  clones from business schools who have been taught a codified way of
  doing business. A business that thrives on being different requires
  different types of people.” (159)
- “Allowing freedom to make mistakes and structuring opportunities for
  success gives children a sense of power over their environment that
  fuels self-esteem, independence, and problem solving.” (163)
- “It’s not the strongest species that survives, nor the most
  intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.” (167)
- “The goal of climbing big, dangerous mountains should be to attain
  some sort of spiritual and personal growth, but this won’t happen if
  you compromise away the entire process.” (173)
- “He not busy being born is busy dying.” (173)
- “I’ve found the cure for depression is action.” (178)
- “The word ‘sustainable’ is another one of those words – like
  ‘gourmet,’ and ‘adventure’ – that have been so overused and misused as
  to become meaningless.” (178)
- “Above all, admitting that I caused the mess and therefore I should
  clean it up is the best way to start living responsibly.” (194)
- “But you are what you do, not what you say you are.” (202)
- “Estimates vary, but even the low end of the spectrum suggests that a
  global switch to regenerative land husbandry would sequester our total
  annual emissions back underground. Which means we could reverse the
  trends of global warming simply by changing the way we farm and
  ranch.” (215)
- “All of us working together can create the change that we need.” (222)
- “You mean I’m the one who has to change?” (227)
- “Just because society is hell-bent on becoming so complex that we
  finally snooker ourselves into a corner with all our stuff, it doesn’t
  mean we have to go there.” (230)
- “I believe the way toward mastery of any endeavor is to work toward
  simplicity; replace complex technology with knowledge. The more you
  know, the less you need.” (231)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### *Lord of the Flies* - William Golding

- “And my heart goes out now to Simon, who knew, who tried to say, of
  the Beast, ‘it’s only us’ and no one would listen.” (Lois Lowry, xv)
- “The simple statement, unbacked by any proof but the weight of Ralph’s
  new authority, brought light and happiness.” (41)
- “On the end of the platform, Piggy was lying flat, looking down into
  the brilliant water. ‘People don’t help much.’ He wanted to explain
  how people were never quite what you thought they were.” (63)
- “‘The thing is – fear can’t hurt you any more than a dream.’” (101)
- “‘What are we? Humans? Or animals? Or savages?’” (112)
- “‘Grownups know things,’ said Piggy. ‘They ain’t afraid of the dark.
  They’d meet and have tea and discuss. Then things ’ud be all right.’”
  (115)
- “‘We just got to go on, that’s all. That’s what grownups would do.’”
  (177)
- “Piggy once more was the center of social derision so that everyone
  felt cheerful and normal.” (190)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### *Meditations* - Marcus Aurelius

- “According to this theory \[Stoicism\], man is like a dog tied to a
  moving wagon. If the dog refuses to run along with the wagon he will
  be dragged by it, yet the choice remains his: to run or be dragged.”
  (Gregory Hays, xx-xxi)
- “We were made, Marcus tells us over and over, not for ourselves but
  for others, and out nature is fundamentally unselfish. In our
  relationships with others we must work for their collective good,
  while treating them justly and fairly as individuals.” (Hays, xxviii)
- “Marcus does not offer us a means of achieving happiness, but only a
  means of resisting pain.” (Hays, xlvi)
- “Optimism in adversity – especially illness.” (8)
- “We were born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the
  two rows of teeth, upper and lower.” (17)
- “… all you have to do is to be attentive to the power inside you and
  worship it sincerely. To worship it is to keep it from being muddied
  with turmoil and becoming aimless and dissatisfied with nature –
  divine and human. What is divine deserves our respect because it is
  good; what is human deserves our affection because it is like us.”
  (21)
- “Each of us lives only now, this brief instant. The rest has been
  lived already, or is impossible to see.” (32)
- “… you can get away from it anytime you like. By going within. Nowhere
  you can go is more peaceful – more free of interruptions – than your
  own soul. (37)
- “That things have no hold on the soul. They stand there unmoving,
  outside it. Disturbance comes only from within – from our own
  perceptions … ‘The world is nothing but change. Our life is only
  perception.’” (38)
- “That every event is the right one. Look closely and you’ll see. Not
  just the right one overall, but *right*. As if someone had weighed it
  out with scales.” (40)
- “Beautiful things of any kind are beautiful in themselves and
  sufficient to themselves. Praise is extraneous. The object of praise
  remains what it was – no better and no worse … Does anything genuinely
  beautiful need supplementing?” (41)
- “And then you might see what the life of the good man is like –
  someone content with what nature assigns him, and satisfied with being
  just and kind himself.” (43)
- “Constant awareness that everything is born from change. The knowledge
  that there is nothing nature loves more than to alter what exists and
  make new things like it. All that exists is the seed of what will
  emerge from it.” (45)
- “Nothing that goes on in anyone else’s mind can harm you. Nor can the
  shifts and changes in the world around you.” (46)
- “To be like the rock that the waves keep crashing over. It stands
  unmoved and the raging of the sea falls still around it.” (48)
- “It’s unfortunate that this has happened. No. It’s fortunate that this
  has happened and I’ve remained unharmed by it – not shattered by the
  present of frightened of the future. It could have happened to anyone.
  But not everyone could have remained unharmed by it … So remember this
  principle when something threatens to cause you pain: the thing itself
  was no misfortune at all’ to endure it and prevail is great good
  fortune.” (48)
- “You don’t love yourself enough. Or you’d love your nature too, and
  what it demands of you.” (53)
- “Is helping others less valuable to you? Not worth your effort?” (53)
- “And when we describe things as ‘taking place,’ we’re talking like
  builders, who say that blocks in a wall or a pyramid ‘take their
  place’ in the structure, and fit together in a harmonious pattern.”
  (56)
- “Things have no hold on the soul. They have no access to it, cannot
  move or direct it. It is moved and directed by itself alone. It takes
  the things before it and interprets them as sees fit.” (60)
- “Existence flows past us like a river: the ‘what’ is in constant flux,
  the ‘why’ has a thousand variations. Nothing is stable, not even
  what’s right here. The infinity of past and future gapes before us – a
  chasm whose depths we cannot see.” (61)
- “… treat human beings as they deserve, be tolerant with others and
  strict with yourself. Remember, nothing belongs to you but your flesh
  and blood – and nothing else is under your control.” (64)
- “You can lead an untroubled life provided you can grow, can think and
  act systematically.” (64)
- “But true good fortune is what you make for yourself. Good fortune:
  good character, good intentions, and good actions.” (65)
- “It’s the truth I’m after, and the truth never harmed anyone. What
  harms us is to persist in self-deceit and ignorance.” (74)
- “Let it happen, if it wants, to whatever it can happen to. And what’s
  affected can complain about it if it wants. It doesn’t hurt me unless
  I interpret its happening as harmful to me. I can choose not to.” (87)
- “Frightened of change? But what can exist without it? What’s closer to
  nature’s heart? Can you take a hot bath and leave the firewood as it
  was? Eat food without transforming it? Can any vital process take
  place without something being changed? Can’t you see? It’s just the
  same with you – and just as vital to nature.” (88)
- “… you don’t need much to live happily.” (96)
- “External things are not the problem. It’s your assessment of them.
  Which you can erase right now. If the problem is something in your own
  character, who’s stopping you from setting your mind straight? And if
  it’s just that you’re not doing something you think you should be, why
  not just do it?” (110)
- “… \[nature\] takes everything within it that seems broken, old and
  useless, transforms it into itself, and makes new things from it. So
  that it doesn’t need material from any outside source, or anywhere to
  dispose of what’s left over. It relies on itself for all it needs:
  space, material, and labor.” (111-112)
- “What doesn’t transmit light creates its own darkness.” (113)
- “What else did you expect from helping someone out? Isn’t it enough
  that you’ve done what your nature demands? You want a salary for it
  too? As if your eyes expected a reward for seeing, or your feet for
  walking. That’s what they were made for. By doing what they were
  designed to do, they’re performing their function. Whereas humans were
  made to help others. And when we do help others – or help them to do
  something – we’re doing what we were designed for. We perform our
  function.” (128)
- “To stop talking about what the good man is like, and just be one.”
  (137)
- “Have I done something for the common good? Then I share in the
  benefits.” (148)
- “A branch cut away from the branch beside it is simultaneously cut
  away from the whole tree. So too a human being separated from another
  is cut loose from the whole community.” (149)
- (rephrase) “How driven are you by your beliefs? How proud are you of
  what you do?” (153)
- “When you start to lose your temper, remember: There’s nothing manly
  about rage. It’s courtesy and kindness that define a human being – and
  a man. That’s who possesses strength and nerves and guts, not the
  angry whiners.” (154)
- “It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other
  people, but care more about their opinion than our own.” (162)
- “Everything’s destiny is to change, to be transformed, to perish. So
  that new things can be born.” (166)
- “That whatever happens has always happened, and always will, and is
  happening at this very moment, everywhere. Just like this. What links
  one human being to all humans: not blood, or birth, but mind.” (167)

### *The Making of Biblical Womanhood* - Beth Allison Barr

- “The study found that evangelicals are the ‘most hesitant’ group in
  supporting women’s work outside the home: only 52 percent ‘are
  comfortable with the future possibility of more women than men in the
  workforce’ (a percentage more than 20 points below that of the general
  American population). Evangelicals also express the most discomfort
  with a female CEO. The study also found that evangelicals are the
  least comfortable with women as pastors (39 percent).” (14)
- “Would this man, the pastor asked, really want to answer the phone? It
  was okay to hire a woman to answer the phone, but the job would be
  demeaning to a man. So demeaning, in fact, that the pastor preferred
  not to hire him, despite our friend’s financial need. The job,
  suitable for a woman to do, was beneath the dignity of a man.” (15)
- “Both systems \[Christian patriarchy and pagan patriarchy\] place
  power in the hands of men and take power away from women. Both systems
  teach men that women rank lower than they do. Both systems teach women
  that their voices are worth less than the voices of men.” (18)
- “Patriarchy by any other name is still patriarchy.” (18)
- “Shouldn’t Christians, who are called to be different from the world,
  treat women *differently*? What if patriarchy isn’t divinely ordered
  but is a result of human sin?” (25)
- “Hierarchy was not God’s will for the first pair, but it was imposed
  when they chose to disregard his commend and eat the forbidden fruit …
  Adam would now be subject to his source (the ground), even as Eve was
  now subject to her source (Adam).” (Alice Matthews, 29)
- “Biblical scholar Clarice J. Martin reminds us that while patriarchy
  defines the boundaries of women’s lives, it also defines ‘subjugated
  people and races as ’the others’ to be dominated.’ Patriarchy walks
  with structural racism and systemic oppression, and it has done so
  consistently throughout history.” (33)
- “The most difficult passages in the Bible to explain, historically
  speaking, are those like Galatians 3:26-28: ‘For in Christ Jesus you
  are all children of God through faith. As many of you as were baptized
  into Christ have clothed yourself with Christ. There is no longer Jew
  or Greek, there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male
  and female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus.’” (36)
- “I knew the problem wasn’t a lack of women leading in church history.
  The problem was simply that women’s leadership has been forgotten,
  because women’s stories throughout history have been covered up,
  neglected, or retold to recast women as less significant than they
  really were.” (84)
- “Despite the significant role women play in church history, and
  despite clear historical evidence of women exercising leadership,
  these popular, modern church history texts present a masculine
  narrative of church history that minimizes female leadership.” (98)
- “Women were encouraged to be chaste, modest, obedient, and passive,
  while men were encouraged to be aggressive, domineering, controlling,
  and active.” (105)
- “\[Isaac\] Marlow argued that singing was unbiblical because if the
  entire congregation sang, women would sing too.” (121)
- “Instead of Scripture transforming society, society transformed how
  early modern Christians interpreted the Bible – and this was
  compounded (as we will see in the next chapter) by the proliferation
  of the English Bible.” (127)
- “Conservative evangelicals believed that the key to reducing sexual
  temptation for men was emphasizing purity for women.” (156)
- “Spacey’s character delivers a line I have never forgotten: ‘The
  greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he
  didn’t exist.’ I haven’t forgotten the line, because I disagree with
  it. The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing Christians
  that oppression is godly. That God ordained some people, simply
  because of their sex or skin color (or both), as belonging under the
  power of other people. That women’s subordination is central to the
  gospel of Christ.” (173)
- “\[Russell Moore\] concludes that it is time to cast a new vision of
  Christianity that ‘provides a biblically and theologically compelling
  alternative’ to egalitarianism – one ‘that sums up the burden of male
  headship under the cosmic rubric of the gospel of Christ and the
  restoration of all things in him.’ It is time, in other words, to
  write female submission into the heart of Christianity.” (174)
- “If the elders considered allowing women to teach or exercise
  authority over men (i.e., teenage boys in Sunday school), it would
  lead to the ‘slippery slope’ (this was the actual phrase used) of
  cultural compromise.” (191)
- “Ideas matter. Ideas that depict women as less than men influence men
  to treat women as less than men. Ideas that objectify women result in
  women being treated like objects (sex objects, mostly).” (212)

### *The Masters: Golf, Money, and Power in Augusta, Georgia* - Curt Sampson

- “Perhaps the lesson is that maintaining a golf course is an unnatural
  act that can have unintended results.” (224)
- “‘I was assigned as an advisor to Lieutenant Colonel Nguyen Phong,’
  Woods said. ‘Phong and I were in combat all the time. Because Phong
  fought like a tiger, I named my son Tiger in his honor.’” (233)

### *Where the Wind Leads* - Vinh Chung

- “One small act today can lead to another and another. Like a line of
  dominoes, where each one plays a minor but essential role, we can each
  play a part. It may only take one act to save one life that can change
  the course of history.” (Richard Stearns, xiii)
- “A forty-one-year-old woman with six children had virtually no
  prospect of remarriage; the only two options for a woman in her
  situation were servitude or prostitution, and she was too proud to do
  either. She faced an almost impossible challenge, the Herculean task
  that would crush most men. So Grandmother Chung rolled up her sleeves
  and went to work.” (11)
- “… the same pressure that can crush coal into dust can also turn
  carbon into diamond, and the same setbacks and disappointments that
  drove my grandfather to despair somehow only made my grandmother more
  determined. Tough times produce tough people …” (14)
- “There is no greater love than to give one’s life for a friend, but
  giving one’s life does not always mean dying – sometimes it means
  living. Living can be a sacrifice, too, and a noble one, especially
  when it’s done to benefit someone else. Dying might require more love,
  but living takes a lot more endurance.” (57)
- “But just because a practice is culturally acceptable does not make it
  right …” (59)
- “My mother believed it was a waste of time and energy to long for the
  past of grumble about new circumstances; the only thing to do was just
  keep moving forward.” (78)
- “Do not believe that you will reach your destination without leaving
  the shore.” (Chinese proverb, 107)
- “Man’s inhumanity to man can be appalling, but it’s nothing compared
  to man’s inhumanity to woman.” (162)
- “It’s an attitude that ought to be instilled in every child: ‘I am a
  naturally intelligent person. I was born to be a superior student.
  Anything is possible for me if I work hard enough.’” (294)
- “\[Better to go for the best and lose than it is to go for second best
  and win\].” (295)

### *Why We Run: A Natural History* - Bernd Heinrich

- “… it turns out that what you have is less important than what you do
  with it.” (83)
- “The mind leads, the body follow.” (126)
- “Running is perhaps the most fundamental of all sports, and it is
  economically the least costly to perform. As a consequence, it is the
  most democratic and most competitive of all sports because individual
  merit can prevail despite economic inequality. It is a sport for
  everyone, the whole world over.” (193)
- “Sure, it’s genetic. But nobody could rationally propose that European
  women are not equally genetically endowed to be able to do precisely
  the same. They just don’t have the same exposure to a culture that
  fosters the practice from very early childhood and then channels
  development … Talent is not enough.” (195)
- “The talent lies not in our genes but in our minds.” (196)
- “Ultimately we are shaped by the anvil of our environment and the
  hammer of our mind, if used.” (197)
- “To psych oneself up takes self-delusion … At that point, one needs
  faith – a combination of ignorance, deliberate blindness, hope, and
  optimism. It defies logic yet makes us able to strive and to survive.”
  (250)
- “Now if you are going to win the battle, you have to do one thing. You
  have to make the mind run the body. Never let the body tell the mind
  what to do. The body will always give up. The body can only handle
  little steps. The mind can take great leaps.” (254)
- “The cup is full. It contains what I had put into it. Like catching an
  antelope, the best things in life that we can experience are served on
  the challenge to endure and to overcome in the long run.” (259)
- “One learns more from one’s mistakes than from one’s successes, and I
  therefore concentrate on them.” (264)
- “Running has saved his life … He had won big. His brain had done it.
  He thought he could do it, and did it. He could have been dead wrong.
  I also feel that I owe much to my running – my education, my health,
  and maybe my life.” (266)
