### *Atomic Habits* - James Clear

- "We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits." (7)
- "A very small shift in direction can lead to a very meaningful change in destination." (17)
- "Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees." (21)
- "'When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that die it -- but all that had gone before." (21)
- "'The score takes care of itself.' The same is true for other areas of life. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead." (24)
- "When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves." (25)
- "It makes no sense to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success." (26)
- "The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to *become* a runner." (34)
- "The most practical way to change *who* you are is to change *what* you do. (38)
- "If you keep casting the same votes you've always cast, you're going to get the same results you've always had. If nothing changes, nothing is going to change." (39)
- "They make you think that you have to choose between building habits and attaining freedom. In reality, the two compliment each other." (46)
- "Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior." (82)
- "You don't have to be the victim of your environment. You can also be the architect of it." (84)
- "Environment design allows you to take back control and become the architect of your life. Be the desginer of your world and not merely the consumer of it." (87)
- "In the long-run, we become a product of the environment that we live in. To put it bluntly, I have never seen someone consistently stick to positive habits in a negative environment." (94)
- "People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It's easier to avoid temptation than resist it." (95)
- "Ultimately, such strategies enable food scientists to find the "bliss point" for each product -- the precise combination of salt, sugar, and fat that excites your brain and keeps you coming back for more. The result, of course, is that you overeat because hyperpalatable foods are more attractive to the human brain." (103)
- "... whatever habits are normal in your culture are among the most attractive behaviors you'll find." (114)
- "The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us." (122)
- "One person might learn to reduce stress by smoking a cigarette. Another person learns to ease their anxiety by going for a run. Your current habits are not necessarily the best way to solve the problems you face; they are just the methods you learned to use. Once you associate a solution with the problem you need to solve, you keep coming back to it." (128)
- "Life feels reactive, but it is actually predictive. All day long, you are making your best guess of how to act given what you've just seen and what has worked for you in the past. You are endlessly predicting what will happen in the next moment." (129)
- "... our behavior is heavily dependent on how we interpret the events that happen to us, not necessarily the objective reality of the events themselves." (129)
- "... for many of us, a little bit of friction can be the difference between sticking with a good habit or sliding into a bad one." (158)
- "The point is to master the habit of showing up. The truth is, a habit must be established before it can be improved." (163)
- "... the costs of your good habits are in the present. The costs of your bad habits are in the future." (189)
- "... the last mile is always the least crowded." (190)
- "The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit." (201)
- "... when successful people fail, they rebound quickly. The breaking of a habit doesn't matter if the reclaiming of it is fast." (201)
- "In our data-driven world, we tend to overvalue numbers and undervalue anything ephemeral, soft, and difficult to quantify. We mistakenly think the factors we can measure are the only factors that exist. But just because you can measure something doesn't mean it's the most important thing. And just because you *can't* measure something doesn't mean it's not important at all." (203)
- "When you can't win by being better, you can win by being different." (225)
- "Boiling water will soften a potato but harden an egg. You can't control whether you're a potato or an egg, but you can decide to play a game where it's better to be hard or soft." (226)
- "Until you work as hard as those you admire, don't explain away their success as luck." (227)
- "'10 years spent learning, 4 years spent refining, and 4 years as a wild success.'" (230)
- "'Men desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly.'" (234)
- "... everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of self-improvement: you have to fall in love with boredom." (235)
- "Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It's the ability to keep going when work isn't exciting that makes the difference." (237)
- "Being curious is better than being smart. Being motivated and curious counts for more than being smart because it leads to action." (261)
- "Your actions reveal how bad you want something. If you keep saying something is a priority but you never act on it, then you don't really want it. It's time to have an honest conversation with yourself. Your actions reveal your true motivations." (262)

___

### *Best Seat in the House* - Jack Nicklaus II & Don Yeager

- "Mom has always said men are simple, and they need three things: food, love, and encouragement -- and they will be fine." (95)
- "You never know what other people are going through in their lives. Even a small interaction when passing someone on a sidewalk can entirely change a person's day. Being respectful, appreciative, kind, caring, and listening to and learning from your friends, family, and strangers is very important. As big as our world is, it truly is small." (122)

___

### *Let My People Go Surfing* - Yvon Chouinard

- "If we could all come to see our consumer products as tools that help us to live our real lives -- rather than as substitutes and surrogates for that life -- we would need many fewer products to be happy. (Naomi Klein, XI)

___

### *The Masters: Golf, Money, and Power in Augusta, Georgia* - Curt Sampson

- "Perhaps the lesson is that maintaining a golf course is an unnatural act that can have unintended results." (224)
- "'I was assigned as an advisor to Lieutenant Colonel Nguyen Phong,' Woods said. 'Phong and I were in combat all the time. Because Phong fought like a tiger, I named my son Tiger in his honor.'" (233)

___

### *Why We Run: A Natural History* - Bernd Heinrich

- "... it turns out that what you have is less important than what you do with it." (83)
- "The mind leads, the body follow." (126)
- "Running is perhaps the most fundamental of all sports, and it is economically the least costly to perform. As a consequence, it is the most democratic and most competitive of all sports because individual merit can prevail despite economic inequality. It is a sport for everyone, the whole world over." (193)
- "Sure, it's genetic. But nobody could rationally propose that European women are not equally genetically endowed to be able to do precisely the same. They just don't have the same exposure to a culture that fosters the practice from very early childhood and then channels development ... Talent is not enough." (195)
- "The talent lies not in our genes but in our minds." (196)
- "Ultimately we are shaped by the anvil of our environment and the hammer of our mind, if used." (197)
- "To psych oneself up takes self-delusion ... At that point, one needs faith -- a combination of ignorance, deliberate blindness, hope, and optimism. It defies logic yet makes us able to strive and to survive." (250)
- "Now if you are going to win the battle, you have to do one thing. You have to make the mind run the body. Never let the body tell the mind what to do. The body will always give up. The body can only handle little steps. The mind can take great leaps." (254)
- "The cup is full. It contains what I had put into it. Like catching an antelope, the best things in life that we can experience are served on the challenge to endure and to overcome in the long run." (259)
- "One learns more from one's mistakes than from one's successes, and I therefore concentrate on them." (264)
- "Running has saved his life ... He had won big. His brain had done it. He thought he could do it, and did it. He could have been dead wrong. I also feel that I owe much to my running -- my education, my health, and maybe my life." (266)
